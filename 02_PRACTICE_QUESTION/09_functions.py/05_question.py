'''Line Equation
Problem Description:

You are given the slope m and the y-intercept b of a line, along with a value x. 
Your task is to calculate and return the value of y using the equation of a line 
in slope-intercept form:


y=mx+b

'''
def calculate_y(slope,intercept,x):
    y = slope*x+intercept
    return y
    
print(calculate_y(4,5,6))
